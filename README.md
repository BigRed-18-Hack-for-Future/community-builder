# Bent Not Broken

Empower communities affected by natural disasters to rebuild through crowdsourcing.

## Inspiration

Communities affected by natural disasters often receive a lot of help immediately after the catastrophe, but this help often dwindles within months, arising from factors such as bureaucratic delays, legal barriers in providing relief, and promises that are not kept or fall short of expectations. We want to focus on the rehabilitation phase of disaster relief recovery, hoping to provide a service empowering communities to band together in rebuilding what was lost. Most of all, we want to remind hurting communities that their spirits may be bent, but certainly aren't broken.

## What it does

Bent not Broken is an online web application where users can create and post disaster relief projects linked to a certain location. Other users can view posted projects along with their location (via the Google Maps API) and have the option of joining the project. There are associated tags corresponding to the type of skills needed to volunteer with each particular relief effort so that users can join projects tailored to their skill sets.

## How we built it

Our technology stack: Firebase + Google Maps + Bootstrap

Firebase is how we store data of users and projects information.

Google Maps API provides extensive visualization, integrated into all major functionality of the platform. A gigantic map view of ongoing local projects on the landing page, with pop-up info windows, is the best place to start reaching out. Associating location with a new project idea is as simple as placing and dragging a new map pin.

## What's next for Bent Not Broken

We think this idea and it's framework are well established, but we're hoping to continue to make modifications and improvements by adding functionality to the web app, expanding the user network, and enhancing the application's visual appeal.

### Roadmap

- Extend tag system, match user skill sets with project needs.
- Extend platform scale, enclose community unit, multiply usage across larger areas.
- Improve authentication system, provide wider options, secure information hierarchy.
- Package platform partial functionality into open-source libraries.
- Experiment with communities in the real world!
